This README describes the scripts used for analysis of samples in the Simons Searchlight cohort

# Scripts
This lists all of the scripts in the subdirectories and a description
- Figure 4/
	- _1_16p11.2_connectors.py_: Identify genes along shortest paths between 16p11.2 genes and Searchlight 16p11.2 deletion proband secondary variant genes
- Figure 7/
	- _1_regressions.py_: Perform linear regressions assessing effects of secondary variants on quantitative phenotypes in 16p11.2 CNV probands
	- _2_gProfiler.py_: Perform GO and KEGG enrichments on secondary variant genes from 16p11.2 CNV probands
- Figure S6/
	- _1_variant_correlations.py_: Calculate Pearson correlations for variant burden and quantitative phenotypes in 16p11.2 CNV probands
