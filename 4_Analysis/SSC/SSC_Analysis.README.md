This README describes the scripts used for analysis of samples in SSC

# Scripts
This lists all of the scripts in the subdirectories and a description
- Figure 7/
	- _1_regressions.py_: Perform linear regressions assessing effects of secondary variants on quantitative phenotypes in autism probands with primary variants
	- _2_interaction_regression.py_: Perform linear regressions to identify multiplicative interactions between primary and secondary variants in SSC probands
	- _3_gProfiler.py_: Perform GO and KEGG enrichments on secondary variant genes from autism probands with primary variants
- Figure S6/
	- _1_variant_correlations.py_: Calculate Pearson correlations for variant burden and quantitative phenotypes in autism probands with primary variants
